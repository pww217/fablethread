## Always runs

Progress is the post-narration storytelling brain. It always executes every turn (never skipped) and feeds next turn's rules call via `recent_events_add` (durable narrative facts), `thread_advance/resolve/add` (unified thread lifecycle with scope-aware age demotion), and `gm_beat` (forward-facing beats stored in `state.meta.pending_gm_beat`).

## GMBeat schema

```
GMBeat
  type: complication | revelation | opportunity | breathing_room | pressure | twist | setback | escalation | callback
  surface_as: ambient | event | npc_behavior | environmental | player_discovery | item (default: ambient)
  beat_expires_turn: int | None (turn number at which the beat expires; set to turn_no + 2 when stored)
```

## Beat lifecycle

The beat flows through three phases per turn:

**Phase 1 — Pre-narration expiry check.** At the start of each turn, the engine reads `state.meta.pending_gm_beat` from the previous turn. If `beat_expires_turn` is set and the current turn number exceeds it, the beat is nullified. Otherwise it proceeds to narration.

**Phase 2 — Narration consumption.** The beat is passed to the narrator via `_narrate_messages(pending_gm_beat=...)`. The narrator uses the beat's type and surface_as metadata as creative guidance alongside the pacing directive. After narration completes, the pending beat is cleared from state — it is not restored for storyteller consumption.

**Phase 3 — Extraction disposition (inferred).** The storyteller receives no pending beat context in its prompt — it decides beats based solely on current extraction data (scene state, threads, pacing context, band). Unlike the previous architecture, there is no explicit `beat_disposition` field. Instead:
- If Progress emits a new `gm_beat`, it replaces the old one (`state.meta.pending_gm_beat = gm_beat` with `beat_expires_turn = turn_no + 2`)
- If Progress emits nothing and the beat's `expires_at` hasn't passed, the engine preserves the existing beat unchanged (carry)
- The engine stores beats with `beat_expires_turn = turn_no + 2` as a hard TTL ceiling. Beats past their expiry are discarded automatically on load.
