# Step 0 — Ruling / Intent Classification

Classifies the player's action, determines whether a dice check is needed, and
identifies which state domains will be active — narrowing every downstream extractor.

## Impossibility check

The ruling LLM evaluates whether the described action is impossible given the character's state, inventory, and scene. An action is impossible when:

- It requires an item the character does not have (firing a gun with no ammo, using a key never acquired)
- It requires a capability contradicted by active conditions (climbing with a broken leg, sneaking while armored and noisy)
- It acts on something not present in the scene (targeting an NPC who is not here, opening a door that doesn't exist)

When `impossible=true`: Python sets `check.required=False`, synthesizes a `RulesOutcome` with `band="fail"` and `rolled=False`, applies momentum, and skips the dice roll entirely. The narrator renders the impossible fact and narrates the natural failure.

## Scene motion

The ruling LLM also determines how the scene should progress: `"hold"` (scene continues at current pace), `"advance"` (something significant happens/resolves), or `"transition"` (player is leaving, write the arrival). This feeds into `_compute_pacing_context()` which produces `outcome_hint` for the narrator.

## Key forward dependency

`rules_outcome` feeds into `_compute_pacing_context()` which produces the single authoritative `PacingContext` struct passed to both Narrator and Storytell pipeline.

## Pacing Context

All pacing signals are collapsed into one Python-computed struct (`PacingContext`) passed to both the Narrator and Storytell pipeline. This replaces six independent fields (`narration_directive`, `deescalate`, `narrative_velocity`, `beat_disposition` output, `quest_threshold_directive`, and stale momentum-derived signals). The narrator receives `outcome_hint` (scene motion); Storytell receives the full struct including `directive`.

### Struct definition

```
PacingContext:
  directive: str           # "" | "Breathe" | "Scene Imperative" | "Overwhelm" | "Pressure" | "Tension" | "Scene Pressure" (may include "; Resolve a Threat" secondary when beat_locked); used by Storytell pipeline
  outcome_hint: str | None # "hold" | "advance" | "transition" — narrator's primary scene motion instruction
  beat_locked: bool        # True: relief fired — Progress MUST emit breathing_room beat; gate unaffected (controlled by deescalate independently)
  gate: "block_escalate" | "allow"  # Controls thread_add; set when deescalate >= 0.5
  summary: str             # human-readable log string, never sent to LLM
```

`beat_locked: True` fires when either `consecutive_pressure_turns >= config.consecutive_pressure_threshold` OR `momentum <= config.momentum_floor`. When locked, `"Resolve a Threat"` is appended to the directive via semicolon. The `gate` field is computed independently from the de-escalation signal (`deescalate >= 0.5` on successful roll with urgent scene threads) — it is unrelated to beat_locked.

### Computation

`_compute_pacing_context()` in `engine/turn.py` consolidates pacing computation (replacing the former scattered functions: `_compute_narration_directive`, `_compute_narrative_velocity`, `_check_floor_relief`). It takes inputs (`momentum`, `consecutive_pressure_turns` from state meta, `arc.threads[] scope=scene urgency counts`) and returns a single struct with directive derived from a priority stack. It also computes `outcome_hint` from the ruling LLM's `scene_motion` and PacingContext escalation signals: ruling `scene_motion` takes priority (`transition` > `advance` > fallback), then `impossible=true` forces `advance`, then Python escalation signals (`beat_locked`, Overwhelm/Pressure with urgent threads) produce `advance`, defaulting to `hold`.

```

Priority order (highest to lowest): **Breathe > Scene Imperative > Overwhelm > Pressure > Tension > Scene Pressure**. The `beat_locked` flag appends `"; Resolve a Threat"` to whatever directive was computed but does not affect the gate (gate is controlled independently by de-escalation signal).

#### Age computation

`_compute_ages(state)` returns only `{"scene_age": scene_age}` — location_age and combat_age removed in Phase 03 pacing overhaul. The ruling phase pre-computes `effective_scene_age = scene_age + 2` when `"combat"` is in scene tags, stored in `ctx._ages["effective_scene_age"]`. This single-age signal drives all directive thresholds:
- Scene Imperative (≥5 effective age): high-priority directive forcing story advancement
- Scene Pressure (3 ≤ effective_age < 5): secondary append to wind down or shift focus

1. **Computed** once in `run_turn()` via `_compute_pacing_context()`.
2. **Passed through** `_run_extraction_pipeline()` → both `_narrate_messages()` and `_storytell_messages()`.
3. **Narrator template** (`narrate_user.j2`) renders `outcome_hint` (scene motion: hold/advance/transition) with value-specific guidance. No Jinja2 pacing computation remains — all pacing computed by Python.
4. **Storytell template** ((`storytell_system.j2` + `user.j2`)) receives the full struct; guidance maps each directive to appropriate thread/beat actions:

| Directive | Thread action |
|-----------|---------------|
| **"Breathe"** (de-escalation, velocity < -0.3) | Do NOT add new threads. Allow existing scene threads to persist without escalation. |
| **"Scene Imperative"** (effective_age ≥ 5) | Story must advance — introduce new development forcing resolution or movement; do not linger |
| **"Overwhelm"** (3+ urgent threads) | May add scene-scoped threads if gate allows; emit pressure/escalation beat |
| **"Pressure"** (1-2 urgent threads) | Advance relevant scene/arc threads. Add new thread only if gate permits. |
| **"Tension"** (background urgency only) | Do NOT add pressures unless concrete threat emerges; prefer advancing existing threads |
| **"Scene Pressure"** (3 ≤ effective_age < 5, secondary append) | Begin winding down or introduce reason to shift focus: development elsewhere, closing window |
| **"" (empty)** | No action required beyond normal aging of silent threads. |

**Note:** Directives may include secondary modifiers joined by semicolons (e.g., "Pressure; Resolve a Threat" when beat_locked). The primary directive drives thread/beat logic; the secondary (`; Resolve a Threat`) acts as thematic guidance for beat type selection. "Resolve a Threat" never appears as a standalone primary directive — it is only appended by the `beat_locked` mechanism. The gate (`block_escalate`/`allow`) is computed independently from `deescalate >= 0.5` on successful rolls — see `PacingContext.gate` under Struct definition above. Gate is unrelated to directive value or beat_locked.

### Consecutive pressure counter

`state["meta"]["consecutive_pressure_turns"]` tracks how many consecutive turns have had Pressure or Overwhelm directives without any thread updates emitted by the storyteller. Updated via two-pass logic at turn end (~turn.py ~1149): increments when directive was Pressure/Overwhelm AND no `thread_update` emitted; resets to 0 otherwise. When this counter reaches `config.consecutive_pressure_threshold` (default 3), it triggers the dual-trigger beat_locked condition alongside momentum floor relief.
